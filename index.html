                <h3>What do you mean, "imaginator"?</h3>
                <p>
                Well, I love to use my mind to solve problems and learn new things while doing it: I am a hacker (programmer, software engineer, you know what I mean).  I like to make computers do things - particulary cool things that help people.  I also daydream a lot.  Oh, and I love languages, too (reading, writing, speaking, you name it).
                </p>

            <article id="what-do-you-do">
                <h3>Oh, right.  Cool!  So... what is it that you do?</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm the author of <a href="http://www.lovehackdesign.com"> www.lovehackdesign.com </a>, a blog I'm starting about passion, life, and programming.  I encourage you to check it out and join me on my journey of figuring out what the heck living a programmer's life really means.  I'm figuring it out along the way, so it should be really fun!  Maybe we can learn from one another ;)

                    Also, I'm currently working on my MSc. thesis in Computer Science, trying to figure out if there are patterns to how breast cancer reacts to different kinds of drugs, based on its genes.  It's incredibly challenging, but it's also really, really interesting and fun.  Computational biology is a wonderfully complex and useful subject - you should learn about it.  There's so much going on with cellular and molecular biology and computing it's crazy.  Really, go check it out!

            <article id="what-for-fun">
                <h3>Nice!  Anything else you do for fun?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah, you bet!  I love animals (last year, my girlfriend and I rescued and found a foster home for a 60-pound German Shepherd "puppy"), and I have tons of fun playing with my pets (they're also a huge boost to sanity!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also love stories in all shapes and sizes, and I get my fix mainly through travel (you know, <em>making</em> them), reading all kinds of books and going to the movies.  My girlfriend and I also really love watching series on Netflix.  Sherlock Holmes, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luther and Humans are some of our latest favorites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I love to cook.  There's something relaxing and artistic about food that's not easy to find anywhere else.  I don't think there's another way to engage all of our senses so effectively - which is why I think cooking is such a wonderful form of expression, and such a great way to build connections.  Some of my favorite dishes are coconut-crusted fish with mango salsa, mozzarella stuffed meatballs and a killer hummus.  I particularly love Italian cuisine.
